# Working With Events Demos
Simple demos showing different, common scenarios related to working with events.

Note: all the demos use the DefaultAzureCredential in order to make running them easier. 
Refer to the following article for more information on setting up the Azure Service Bus client and using managed identities:

## Versioning Demos
There are three different demos to show the following:
- An initial state, no versioning consideration.
- A non-breaking change:
- A breaking change where you need to version the events.

There is a readme.md [here](/versioning_demos/README.md) explaining how to run each demo along with additional details.
